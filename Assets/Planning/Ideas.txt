Ludum Dare 49 - Theme: Unstable

- Use a wrecking ball to destroy buildings.. how to make fun?

The future is now. You are piloting a brand new demoloplane, responsible for flying through the city and demolishing old buildings. Attached to your plane is a wrecking ball, make sure you demolish old buildings, and not the new ones! Consecutive demolished buildings = extra points, destroy a new building and it is game over.

- Stilts

Running game where you control a person on stilts through progressively harder levels. Move the stilts using WASD and the arrow keys, or a controller.

- Ropes

Use ropes to stabilise a bridge, spiderman style
Fishing game, catch larger fish/deeper for more points, wobbly boat, stuff pushes line or cuts it.

You swing from rope to rope (or grappeling hook) killing robots/enemies and dodging traps. The recoil propels you. Get to the end of the level without running out of bullets (Your bullets is your propellant and used to kill enemies)

You need to transport a radioactive payload.. You do this with swinging ropes.. Don't touch the walls

- Tetris Jenga

Place blocks, but ocasionally you need to delete a block instead of placing it.

- Giraffe

You are a giraffe, and you need to collect things, as giraffes do. Your neck keeps growing, and you have to balance it to prevent it from snapping.
